# OneDev

## System requirements

I run it on a CentOS server with 1 core and 2 GB memory, although the authority of OneDev suggested that 2 core and 2GB is better.

## Prepare

Make a directory named `data`, this directory will be mapped to Docker.

Init works of OneDev will be finished by it's page. Therefore, it's not necessary to configure any information such as password in text file.

In a word, run `docker-compose.yml up -d`.
